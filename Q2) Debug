(* A- factorial 5 should return 120 *)

let rec factorial (n : int) : int =
  if n = 0 then 1                      (* Replaced the "n = 0 then 0" with "n = 0 then 1" as factorial of 0 is 1. *)
  else n * factorial (n - 1)


(* B- fibonacci 5 should return 5 *)

let rec fibonacci (n : int) : int =
  if n = 0 then 0
  else if n = 1 then 1
  else fibonacci (n - 1) + fibonacci (n - 2)        (* Removed the "+ 1" as it was extra and incorrect.*)


(* C- maybe your GCD code wasnâ€™t working! *)

let rec gcd a b =
  if a = b then a
  else if a > b then gcd (a - b) b                   (* Applied brackets to the argument "a-b", as without it the syntax would be wrong. *)
  else gcd a (b - a)                                 (* Applied brackets to the argument "b-a", as without it the syntax would be wrong. *)
